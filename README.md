# golf-horse-zymic
This is a "sanitized" version of my entry "zymic" submitted to the Wordle Golf Horse competition. http://golf.horse/wordle/
"Sanitized" means that I've altered the key numeric parameters and replaced the compressed data with a different wordlist.

zymic_sanitized_explained shows the code after the JavaScript is decompressed and adds comments, so this is useful to view if you want to learn how my submission works. Please see my series of articles at https://www.luke-g.com/wordle-golf-horse/ for a complete explanation.
